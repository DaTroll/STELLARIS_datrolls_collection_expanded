The Kas'lu builded small sedementary civilisations with different ethnicites. However they are always open for newcomers or trade. Also some settlements have developped strong religions and leaders of thoses.                 Most of them still agree with the peacefull way.              Their government is composed with the second settlement leader being sent to the Capital and representing his settlement. "
