Their larve like skin and pores have immense absorbtion capacities, aswell as blocking capacities, which even makes them capable to survive in outer space with no suit or whatsoever. They do also posses an incredible sense of smell, spotting enemies a long time in advance. Making them good hunters. Due to been a Hive they will prove an ultimate level of compedence and coordination within their attacks and their strategies."
