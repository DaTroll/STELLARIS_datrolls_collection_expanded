Some scientist speculated about the interior of the Anypomo being as active as the inside of a small star. The planet was, once a long time ago, a dense mountainous forest, but the hyperactivity and speed of the Anypomo made it a desert world with not much else on it. Their high energy transformed itself into a born-like attitude towards war and energy harvesting. Their keen hability to change and to survive will surely be a problem for anyone colonizing planets next to them."
