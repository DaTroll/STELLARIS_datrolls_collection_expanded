In their past they often opted to violence and carred little about the consequences. Their reckless nature turned their rich planet into a basic wasteland of sand and dune seas. The worst consequence of all was perhaps the destruction of their oft physiology, and the aim to ever get better in a pure violent way of forging war, this has led them to wear a hightech cyber-suit, equiped with enhencing drugs and optimized survival tools. Make no mistake, they don't seek peace. "
