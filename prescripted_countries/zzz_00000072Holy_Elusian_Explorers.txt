The Elusians have no concept of after-life because they consider themselves already as being in the after-life. Alpha-H, also known as first Heaven is truly a paradise. For millions of years they have already been on this planet. Xenologues often describe them as \"Angel-like\" because of their sort of wings.The Elusian have never known armed conflict and never aim to it. A compromise can always be found thus no one knowswhat they are really capable of. "
