But this never happend. Lock is the Name every single Unit takes when they become the Leader. Perhaps it is not really researched how they elect new leaders within a Hive Mind. But another really interesting point is one of their morphological abilities: they gravitate. How do they gravitate? This would perhaps be a great scientific mystery we could solve!"
