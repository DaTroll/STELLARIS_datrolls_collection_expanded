All they want is simply all. They had many dictatures and Empires in the past, but it never worked with a greedy populace, all wanting some of everything, therefore established the democracy. To add to that, they are deeplyintelligent, always in quest of more knowledge. Somehow, they live on a ring world, their history doesnt mention a transition, letting it suggest that they, since ever, lived on the Ring world. "
