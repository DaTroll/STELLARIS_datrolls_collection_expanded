After the coup they imposed harsch conditions on the Nefas. The Nefas have for centuries been subjugated and enslaved to the Naoran.The current authoritarian Regime has planned to enslave all of the remaining Nefa without remorse. The Nefa fought bravely but now their are brokenand lost hope. Once the Nefa will have expired the Naoran will certainly be looking for a new specie to subjugate and enslave for their own use. Be aware of the need of Slaves. "
