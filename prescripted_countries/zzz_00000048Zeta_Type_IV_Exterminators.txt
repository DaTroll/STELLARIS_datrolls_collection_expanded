Or perhaps, what did he think, when they gained consciounsness and startet to attack their creators? The Machine quickly overran the Planet and destoryed it, ultimately turning it into a Tomb Wolrd. They quickly hacked all the operating systems and thus reached Space Flight within a few decades. You better extermine them as soon as possible, or risk to be at their mercy.
