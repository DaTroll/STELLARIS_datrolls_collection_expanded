The Delcca Nation landed successfully on Delcce Tam' and amidst the extremly hostile environment, they were able to settle and thrive, learning how to respect the local wildlife and limiting their own expendentures. The current need to watch out for the wild life and to limit one's consumerims made their civilisation also more long-aging aswell as more reflective about itself."
